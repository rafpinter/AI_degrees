# MovActors_AI

MovActors_AI is an artificial intelligence that finds you the shortest movie-actors.

## Usage

```bash
python degrees.py
```

## Example

```bash
Name: Kevin Bacon
Which 'Kevin Bacon'?
ID: 9323132, Name: Kevin Bacon, Birth: 
ID: 102, Name: Kevin Bacon, Birth: 1958
Intended Person ID: 102
Name: Sylvester Stallone
2 degrees of separation.
1: Kevin Bacon and Robert De Niro starred in Sleepers
2: Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone starred in Grudge Match
```

## Consideration

This is a project from Harvard's [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/)

Please note that my work is the degrees.py's function shortest_path(), where I implemented the artificial intelligence that finds you the shortest movie-actors connection.
